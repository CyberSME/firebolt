Feature: Test if RHOST is vulnerable to ms08_067 exploit
	Background:
	Given "metasploit" is installed
	And the following profile:
	| name         | value         |
	| RHOST        | 192.168.1.218 |

	Scenario: Check if RHOST is vulnerable


		When I launch a "metasploit" attack with:
		"""
		msfconsole -x "use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi; set RHOST <RHOST>; check; exit"
		"""

		Then it should pass with:
		"""
		The target is not exploitable.
