AttackIQ offers the first live remote testing platform that continuously challenges your security assumptions.

Scenarios are used to test controls, validate security posture, and instrument your environment. They consist of behaviors that execute unwanted behavior or mimic real world malicious activity. By testing these things you can confirm your protective and detective controls are functioning as designed.
Scenarios can be run on-demand or on automated schedules to continually challenge your security infrastructure.

Some example *attack* scenario subjects:
+ Persistence
+ Privilege Escalation
+ Lateral Movement
+ Access to other Data Stores
+ C&C
+ Ex-filtration

Some example *validation* scenario test subjects:
+ Access/Routing/Availability
+ Data Loss Prevention
+ Content/Web Filtering
+ Firewall
+ Network and Host IPS/IDS
+ AntiVirus
+ SIEM
+ SSL Certificates

Many of these listed techniques can be replicated in python coupled with arguments and verbose output.
